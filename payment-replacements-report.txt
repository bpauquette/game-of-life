Notes:
- No explicit patreon/opencollective/github.com/sponsors/buymeacoffee/paypal domains found in tracked frontend source files (excludes package-lock.json and node_modules).
- package-lock.json and dependencies contain many sponsorship/opencollective/patreon entries (normal for dependencies) — these are not user content but will be touched by a history rewrite if you include them.
